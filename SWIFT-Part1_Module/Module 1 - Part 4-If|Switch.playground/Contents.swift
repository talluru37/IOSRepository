 1. Parentheses aren't required - To make our code simpler
 2. Curly Braces are required - To make our code safer

/* Swifty Syntax
 1. Parentheses aren't required around the variable (abbrev) as we do in some programming languages
 2. Tip: You can include symbols/emoji (Edit -> Symbols/Emojis)ðŸ˜Ž
 3. In Swift, a switch must be exhaustive - Which means "All possibilities must be covered in Swift" by using 'default' case
 4. In Swift, each case must include atleast one executable line of code - no automatic fallthrough
 5. In Swift we do not need a break statement at the end of each case
 6. In Swift we can write one case which can take multiple values (Ex: case 1,2,3:)/(Ex: case EX,Ex,ex:)
 7. Range operator is allowed - case 1...3 - 1 to 3 including 1 and 3
